# **PROG366_FA23**
    A repository of assignments for PROG366, Algorithms.
***
## **Assignment 1**
This C# program demonstrates different time complexities in the context of Big O Notation: Constant (O(1)), Linear (O(n)), and Quadratic (O(n^2)).
- ##  **O(1) Example (Lines 16-21 Program.cs | Lines 31-44 Utility.cs):**
  - In this part of the code, the `IsTrue` method is called with a single boolean value, `O1`. The `IsTrue` method checks if the provided boolean value is true or false, always performing the same set of operations regardless of the input value. It exhibits constant time complexity O(1) because the execution time is not dependent on the size of the input.
- ## **O(n) Example (Lines 21-28 Program.cs | Lines 46-58 Utility.cs):**
  - In this part of the code, the `EnumerablePrintAll` method is called with an array of boolean values, `On`. The method prints all the values in the enumerable sequence with their indices. The time it takes to execute this method is linearly proportional to the number of elements in the array, making it exhibit a linear time complexity O(n).
- ## **O(n^2) Example (Lines 28-34 Program.cs | Lines 60-79 Utility.cs):**
  - In this part of the code, the `EnumerablePrintCounts` method is called with the same array, `On`. This method prints the counts of distinct values in the input enumerable sequence. Inside the method, there are nested loops, resulting in a quadratic time complexity O(n^2) because the execution time grows quadratically as the input size increases.

## **Assignment 2**
This C# program demonstrates the Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm, efficiently shuffling elements randomly to ensure that each possible permutation is equally likely. It is useful for applications like shuffling cards or generating random orderings of items in a list.
- ## **Initialization (Lines 16-19 U_Shuffle.cs):**
  - The algorithm starts with an unshuffled collection, passed as the input to the `FYShuffle` method.
  - It initializes a random number generator (`Random rand`) to generate random indices used in shuffling.
- ## **Copying to an Array (Lines 19-22 U_Shuffle.cs):**
  - The input collection is copied to an array (`unshuf_arr`). This array will be used for shuffling the elements.
- ## **Shuffling (Lines 23-30 U_Shuffle.cs):**
  - The Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm iterates over the array in reverse order, swapping elements randomly.
  - After shuffling, the method returns the shuffled array.
- ## **Result (Line 32 U_Shuffle.cs):**
  - After shuffling is complete, the method returns the shuffled array, now a randomly permuted version of the original unshuffled collection.
- ## **Summary:**
  - The `FYShuffle` method takes an unshuffled collection, converts it into an array, and then performs the Fisher-Yates Shuffle on that array. The result is a shuffled array of the same type as the input collection.
***
## **Assignment 3**
This C# program demonstrates the use of different data structures for working with data, including Arrays, Hashtables, Stacks, and Queues.
- ## **Arrays (Lines 63-80 Program.cs):**
  - In the `ReadIntoArray` method, data from an XML file is read and stored in an array of dynamic arrays.
  - Arrays allow for quick indexing, facilitating fast access to elements by their position (index) in the array.
- ## **Hashtables (Lines 86-101 Program.cs):**
  - In the `ReadIntoHashtable` method, data from the XML file is read and stored in a Hashtable.
  - Hashtables provide fast key-based access, making them suitable for scenarios where data needs to be accessed using a specific identifier.
- ## **Stacks (Lines 107-122 Program.cs):**
  - In the `ReadIntoStack` method, data from the XML file is read and stored in a Stack of Tuple objects.
  - Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, making them useful for scenarios where elements need to be processed in reverse order.
- ## **Queues (Lines 128-143 Program.cs):**
  - In the `ReadIntoQueue` method, data from the XML file is read and stored in a Queue of Tuple objects.
  - Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, making them suitable for scenarios where elements need to be processed in the order of their appearance.
